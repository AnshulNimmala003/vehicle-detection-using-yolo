# vehicle-detection-using-yolo

YOLO is a real-time object detection model that can be used to detect vehicles in images and videos. This project will use YOLOv8 to detect cars, trucks, and other vehicles.

ðŸ”¥ Project Overview

âœ” Detect vehicles in images, videos, or live camera feed
âœ” Use YOLOv8 for real-time detection
âœ” Display bounding boxes around detected vehicles
âœ” Count the number of vehicles in a frame
âœ” Save processed videos with detections
